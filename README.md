1. Pre-save hook : The pre hook verifies stock availability and updates inventory before saving an order. This helps us in many ways. Before sending data to the server, we can apply various logic and make changes to the data using pre-hooks. This is extremely useful in many scenarios.

2. post-save hook : The post-save hook in Mongoose is a middleware function that runs after a document has been saved to the database. This is useful for performing additional tasks or side effects after an entity has been successfully created or updated. Below are some key benefits of using a post-save hook: error handeling, Asynchronous Operations,Data Logging.

3. Type-Script : TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles down to plain JavaScript. It introduces several powerful features that improve the development experience, code quality, and overall maintainability of applications. Below are some key advantages of using TypeScript: 6. Early Bug Detection
   ,Type Inference,Better Maintainability.

4. Mongoose : Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a higher-level abstraction over MongoDB's native driver. Mongoose allows you to define schemas for your data, making it easier to organize and enforce the structure of your MongoDB documents. This brings more structure and consistency to NoSQL databases, which are typically schema-less, improving data integrity. Mongoose supports middleware (also known as hooks) which allows you to define pre- and post-save operations.

5. ESLint : ESLint is a widely used static code analysis tool that helps developers find and fix problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code. It improves code quality, consistency, and maintainability.

6. Prettier : Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that automatically formats code according to predefined rules. It focuses on maintaining consistent code style and improving the readability of code.

7. Aggregation Pipeline : The Aggregation Pipeline in MongoDB is a framework for performing data transformations and computations on collections.
